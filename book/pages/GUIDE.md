# Developer guide

The simplest way to get going uses Cyberpunk 2077's native game system called [AudioSystem](./AUDIO_SYSTEM.md), as you normally would with *vanilla*[^1] sounds.

When you start requiring a little bit more control, or want to add-in some audio effects, it's usually time to reach for [AudioSystemExt](./AUDIO_SETTINGS_EXT.md) and [AudioSettingsExt](./AUDIO_SETTINGS_EXT.md).

And you can also modify [Global Parameters](./PARAMETERS.md) at anytime during the game session.

Last but not least, your sounds can be played on audio emitter(s) thanks to [Spatialization](./SPATIALIZATION.md).

[^1]: *vanilla* describes everything originally belonging to the game, as opposed to further modifications or *mods* made by the community.
