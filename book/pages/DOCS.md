# Docs

The traditional Rust docs can be found [here](./docs/doc/audioware/index.html)ðŸ¦€, but they are still being written and rather incomplete at the moment.

It merely contains implementation details, so if you're more interested in using Audioware right away please head back to the [Developer Guide](./GUIDE.md).
