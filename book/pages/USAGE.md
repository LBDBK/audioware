# How to use?

In [Getting started](./GETTING-STARTED.md) we already saw that adding custom sounds for Cyberpunk 2077 with Audioware literally boils down to 2 steps:

1. define your audios in [Manifest](./MANIFEST.md)(s): see how to further describe your audio assets along optional settings and metadata.
1. play them in-game with scripting [API](./API.md): using [CET][CET] or [Redscript][Redscript] to control how / when they get played, stopped, switched, etc.

All audios have some automations built-in, that you can read about in [Integration](./INTEGRATION.md)
