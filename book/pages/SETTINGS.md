# Settings

Any sound will accept the following settings.

## Volume

You can set `Volume` factor as follow:

```yml
my_custom_audio:
  file: ./somewhere/audio.wav
  settings:
    volume: 2.0 # 2 times louder !
my_other_audio:
  file: ./somewhere/else/audio.ogg
  settings:
    volume: 0.5 # 2 times softer
```

## Start time

This will play your audio with a delay.

```yml
my_custom_audio:
  file: ./somewhere/audio.wav
  settings:
    start_time: 10s # 10 seconds delay
```

## Start position

This will play your audio further from start.

```yml
my_custom_audio:
  file: ./somewhere/audio.wav
  settings:
    start_position: 1s # start playing directly at 1s
```

```admonish warn
Note that digit with decimal(s) is not supported, so if you would like to start the audio at e.g. `1.2s`, please specify `120ms` instead.
```

## Loop region

This will play your audio in a loop, only the part that you specify.

```yml
my_custom_audio:
  file: ./somewhere/audio.wav
  settings:
    loop_region:
      starts: 120ms # starts directly from 1.2s
      ends: 8s # ends at 8s
```

```admonish hint
You're not required to specify `starts` or `ends`.
If left unspecified:

- `starts` will start at the beginning of the audio.
- `ends` will play until the end of the audio.
```

## Playback rate

This will play your audio faster, or slower.

```yml
my_custom_audio:
  file: ./somewhere/audio.wav
  settings:
    playback_rate: x0.5 # plays twice as slow
```

```yml
my_custom_audio:
  file: ./somewhere/audio.wav
  settings:
    playback_rate: x2 # plays twice as fast
```

You can also specify the value in semitones as follow.

```yml
my_custom_audio:
  file: ./somewhere/audio.wav
  settings:
    playback_rate: 2â™¯ # adjusts by 2 semitones
```

## Panning

This adjust from where the audio originates from, from left to right. The value **must** be between `0.0` and `1.0` (inclusive).

```yml
my_custom_audio:
  file: ./somewhere/audio.wav
  settings:
    panning: 0.0 # plays fully on left side
```

```yml
my_custom_audio:
  file: ./somewhere/audio.wav
  settings:
    panning: 1.0 # plays fully on right side
```

## Fade-in tween

This will play your audio gradually fading-in.

```yml
my_custom_audio:
  file: ./somewhere/audio.wav
  settings:
    fade_in_tween:
      start_time: 1s # starts playing directly from 1s
      duration: 3s # fade-in duration
      easing: Linear # fade-in curve
```

Note that `fade-out` can be specified when calling methods like `Play`, `Switch`, etc.

## Usage

This last setting allows to specify how the audio will be handled in memory.

```yml
my_custom_audio:
  file: ./somewhere/audio.wav
  usage: on-demand
```

Usage can be:

- `in-memory`: the audio is loaded all-at-once in-memory on game startup and kept around for the whole duration of the game session.
  > this is useful for short sounds that are meant to be played frequently.
- `on-demand`: the audio is loaded all-at-once each time on-demand, and never kept in-memory.
  > this is useful when you don't want to allocate memory for sounds, or that a sound is not meant to be played frequently.
- `streaming`: the audio is streamed on-demand.
  > this is useful for long-lasting sounds that should not be loaded all-at-once in-memory. A streamed sound is always loaded on-demand.
