# Getting started

Audioware is a native plugin to play custom audios in Cyberpunk 2077, *without* REDmod.

## ‚ÜòÔ∏è Install

- grab [Audioware latest release](https://github.com/cyb3rpsych0s1s/audioware/releases/latest) and unzip it in root game folder.
- make sure you have both [Codeware 1.11.1+](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-codeware/releases) and [TweakXL 1.10.2+](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-tweak-xl/releases) installed too.

## üìÑ Define audios

Create a folder e.g. `MyMod` for your mod, located either:

- under `mods\MyMod`
- or `r6\audioware\MyMod`
but not both !

Create a manifest e.g. `audios.yml`.

In its simplest form, here's how it looks like:

```yml
version: 1.0.0
sfx:
  my_custom_audio: some.mp3 # accepts most common formats like .wav / .ogg / etc
```

## ‚èØÔ∏è Use in-game

```swift
GameInstance.GetAudioSystem(game).Play(n"my_custom_audio");
```
